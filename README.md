# Project Title: Financial-Analysis Using Python Libraries.

### Project Description: 
                     In this project, we took help from Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib to create amazing visualizations.
                     This project analyzes financial data using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib. The project reads financial data from an Excel file, processes it, and then 
                     generates visualizations to analyze the data.
                     
### Execution: 
               In the course of this project, I imported my Libraries, imported my dataset, explored my dataset, cleaned and prepared my data before visualizing it. 
               This enabled me, draw conclusive insights from my analysis.

### Some of the data visualized are as follows:
        .  Analyzed the segment sector.
        .  Analyzed the manufacturing price.
        .  Analyzed the products and discount band by segment.
        .  Counted the products sold in each year.
        .  Analyzed the products by date sold.
        .  Analyzed the profit obtained in each month.
        .  Analyzed the profit made by each product.
        .  Analzed the profit made by each segment.
        .  Analyzed the products by sale price.
        .  Analyzed segment by year and discount band by products.
